# DeSola-RAT

## Overview

DeSola-RAT is a research project focused on studying the architecture and behavior of **Remote Access Tools (RATs)** and **Command and Control (C2)** systems within a controlled and ethical environment.

The goal is to better understand how remote administration mechanisms operate so defenders and security researchers can improve detection, analysis, and mitigation strategies.

## Purpose

- Analyze RAT and C2 communication models  
- Learn how remote command execution and response handling works at a conceptual level  
- Support malware analysis, reverse engineering, and defensive security research  
- Strengthen blue team and ethical hacking knowledge
